BWW.com is a musician/band website built using the Jekyll CMS and is hosted on Github Pages with the goal of having a minimal backend with no need for a database as well as free hosting. Users are still able to update website content by editing and adding documents from within their Github Repo via the web interface. 

## How to create a new blog post

1. From the Repository’s home page, click "_posts".
2. Click the + sign near the top of the page.
3. In the “Name your file…” field, add your posts date and title in the following example format:

	'''YYYY-MM-DD-this-is-the-title-of-your-post.markdown
	'''

4. In the empty body section of the page, fill in the first 5 lines of code with “Front Matter” information, following the example format:

	'''---
	layout: post
	title:  “This is the title of your post“
	date:   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
	---
	'''

5. Next, simply add the content of your blog. Remember to double space between paragraphs.
6. Scroll to the bottom and click “Commit new file”.
